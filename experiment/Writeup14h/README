CITEseq_bone_marrow_25antibody.RData:
 - 30672 cells for bone marrow, 17009 genes (2000 after filtering), 25 antibodies
 - Preprocessed by Kevin (see /home/stat/kevinl1/project/Multiome_CCA/git/multiomicCCA_analysis/experiment/Writeup11/Writeup11_citeseq_pbmc25_preprocess.R)
 - The data originally comes from the SeuratData package (i.e., run the following lines in R:
====
SeuratData::InstallData("bmcite")
bm <- SeuratData::LoadData(ds = "bmcite")
